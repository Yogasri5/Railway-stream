**Railway Reservation System**
This project is a Railway Reservation System built using Streamlit and SQLite. It allows users to view train schedules, book tickets, cancel bookings, and provides the admin with the ability to add or delete trains from the system. The system uses Streamlit for a simple and interactive web interface, and SQLite as the database to store the train schedules and booking information.

**Features
Add a Train:**
Admins can add new train schedules, including train number, name, source, destination, departure and arrival times, and available seats.

**View Trains:**
Users can view a list of all available trains with details such as train number, name, source, destination, departure/arrival times, and available seats.

**Delete a Train:**
Admins can delete trains from the system by specifying the train number. This removes the train's information from the database.

**Book a Train:**
Users can book a ticket for a train. The system checks seat availability, and upon booking, the number of available seats is updated.

**Cancel Booking:**
Users can cancel their bookings and the system updates the available seats accordingly.

**Tech Stack
Frontend:**
**Streamlit:** A Python library to build web applications with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. It is used to create the interactive user interface for the Railway Reservation System.
**Backend:**
**SQLite:** A lightweight, serverless SQL database that stores all the train schedule and booking information in a single file, making it perfect for this small-scale project.
**Programming Language:**
**Python**: The primary language for implementing the backend logic and integrating it with Streamlit and SQLite.
